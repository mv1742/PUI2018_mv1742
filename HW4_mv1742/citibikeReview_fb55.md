# Idea
ok but you should say why this is interesting and why you would think that

# Null hypothesis
not clear, please look at it and phrase it correctly.
Subscribers bike on weekends? you meant "the frction of subscriber biking on weekends (compared to weekdays)"?
So are we talking about number of rides?
also "fraction" not "proportion" is the right word

# Formula
Does not render. I know m inde did not either, but you should not perpetrate my mistakes!
also, this is basically my notebook with minimal modification. it is ok, but you loost an opportunity to learn and practice this way.

# Data

not finished. you need to group week days and weekends into 2 groups per each user type, 
take the average (over multiple weeks) fraction of number of rised rides per day of the week to weekend days for each class, 
and its stndard deviation

# Test

this is a test for proportions: a chi sq test would be appropriate and better than a Z test, since the Z test assumes gaussianity while the chi sq test is non-parametric
