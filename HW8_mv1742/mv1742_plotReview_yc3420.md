## Plot peer review for Manrique Vargas

Manrique made a choropleth map for HW8 assignment. The data is downloaded directly from open database which means this plot is reproducible and it is closely related to the urban topic. The color map choice that Manrique used is viridis which is friendly to the most common types of color blindness. (Here I also recommend an open source tool for color blindness simulator http://colororacle.org) There are title, legend, data source and caption attached to the image which improve the readability of this plot. It might be better if Manrique could clarify in the title and caption which “district”is used in this plot. Another suggestion is that, the district with no data should also be included in the map (only the boundary). Now it is relatively hard to identify this is a NYC map. But generally, an interesting topic and a great delivery.
