# Other Statistical Test Figures (Ancova, Mancova, Spearman's rank)
  
Include the main plot of the paper (the plot that summarized the result)

Figure 1. Parameters of respiratory analysis of controls, patients and relatives are presented.
The pattern of significantly altered values of patients in comparison to controls is represented in A–F. The increased breathing rate of patients is presented in A. As shown in B, the inspiratory-to-expiratory time ratio is increased in patients indicating a reduction of the exhalation time. Patients breathe shallowly as indicated in C. Most pronounced are increased frequency bands of respiration as indicated in D–F. Boxes indicate data between the 25th and 75th percentile with the horizontal bar reflecting the median (□ = mean; - = 1st and 99th percentile; x = minimum and maximum of data). Significant differences of Bonferoni corrected pair-wise comparisons are indicated: * p<.05; ** p<.01; *** p<.001

"Figure 4. Optimal cutoff on Logistic Regression probabilities.

Plot of sensitivity (percentage of correctly classified cases of critical scalar stress) and specificity (percentage of correctly classified cases of not critical scalar stress) versus community size. Reference line: intersection point at which there is a balance between sensitivity and specificity; it corresponds to the optimal cutoff on logistic regression probabilities (community size 127 = p 0.50). See also Table 2.

"Figure 5. Logistic Regression model.

A) Best fitting logistic curve (plus 95% confidence band) for the critical level of scalar stress as derived from Olsen’s Hutterite fissioning data. Vertical axis: probability of experiencing not critical/critical scalar stress; horizontal axis: community size in terms of sheer number of individuals. Lower probabilities of experiencing a critical level of scalar stress are associated with smaller community sizes and higher probabilities with larger community sizes. B) Scalar stress (sensu Johnson) chart plus critical threshold as derived by the logistic regression model. Black line: scalar stress as function of number of individuals; it is equal to (n2−n)/2, where n is the number of interacting subjects. Vertical lines: in green, group size threshold at which the probability of critical scalar stress begins to change from low to high (i.e., p = 0.50; mid-point: 126.9; 95% confidence interval: 121.9–131.9); in red, group size threshold at which the probability of critical scalar stress reaches its maximum (i.e., p = 0.99; mid-point: 158.2; 95% confidence interval: 146.6–169.8). See also Table 3. The gradient in the shaded area is meant to visually represent the increase in probability between the two thresholds."

## Description of assignment 2
In this assginment we choose 3 tests of statistical analyses and go to web page of the journal PLOS ONE to search for articles that use those tests.Put the name of my tests in the search and choose a paper that uses the test we selected. Read the relevant portions of the paper and identify what are the Dependent Variables (DV), Independent Variables (IV), and, if applicable, control variables, how many they are, and what type they are (categorical, continuous...).
