## CLARITY

The title could have used a clear format for the date. e.g. "September 2014"
It is not clear what the dashes mean (error bars?)

## ESTHETIC

The font should be larger. The font is too small as a proportion of the figure. 
The colours are not consistent with the legend.
Make sure the colour scheme is readible by colour blinded people - see colour blind friendly notes from the professor in Lesson 7:

## HONESTY

The scale of the axis is good.
However it would be better to have the bars for next to each other (not stacked) to compare their magnitude.
