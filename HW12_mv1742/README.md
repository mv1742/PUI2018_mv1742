# HW12

Did all of the HW together with Mark Bauer, Timur Murkhtarov, Alia Kassem, and Sarah Aita.

## Assignment 1

Assignment 1 was about studying periodicity in time-series using Fourier transformation.
Fourier can transform the power of a time series.

Annual periodicity makes sense since there are annual events once a year like Christmas, Thanksgiving, and other holidays that show same patters annually. 

It is possible that the maximum power comes from a line that has particular ridership once a year where ridership increases considerably  for this line, or other touristic events that have particular behaviour every year.

## Assignment 2

Comparison of findings from two clustering methods
The clustering methods gave us similar results in that both of them show a trend of increasing number of business for clusters that represent most of New York (outer boroughs and most of Manhattan).

Seemingly, K-Means produced more distinguished trends in Time Series, while agglomerative clustering produced some interesting drops in the beginning of Cluster 2 Time Series and in the middle of Cluster 3 Time Series. This would be interesting to explore in further analyses.
